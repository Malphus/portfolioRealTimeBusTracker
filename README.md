# Real Time Bus Tracker
This is suppose to be a real time tracker for the bus that runs between the MIT campus and the Harvard campus.  This is a work in progress.

HOW TO RUN: Download associated files and run in a web browser.  However it will not track the bus and please update code with your own API key from Mapbox.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: This one is a work in progress because I was having difficulty with setting up the marker with the information from the Boston Bus system so it would move with real time movement of the bus.  I am still working on getting the 1 bus to run.  Once I've got that down I think it would be nice to add multiple buses that can be selected, as well as other cities that have public api's for bus tracking.
